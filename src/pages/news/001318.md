> Message 1318 : Wed Mar 17 (Felagund)   :: More on Goblin Gate

A few more notes: Glob the Tentmaster reports that some of his orcs seem to
be mysteriously disappearing in the forest near his encampment, a
significantly larger number than usual. Common orcs should expect little
protection in the currently implemented zones around Goblin Gate; more
material for this group will be available at a later date. Further, let there
be no confusion as to the previous post. By changes I mean that certain
aspects have gotten easier, but others have gotten harder. Certain areas that
were not intended to be as difficult as they are have been modified slightly,
while some significant changes have been made to areas that should not be so
easy. Please use caution.
