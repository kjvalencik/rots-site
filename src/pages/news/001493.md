> Message 1493 : Sat Jan 27 (Kandi)      :: Policy Change

Since there are multiple players from the same or similar IPs (home
networks, computer labs, etc.) I would like to inform you of the policy
changes for these players.
1) You must play on the same side.
2) 'Boting' will not be allowed. By boting I mean playing via triggers,
etc. (For single players boting is still legal)
3) If your friend logs off a darkie, you must wait 20 mins to log your whitie.
Or vise versa.

The first two only apply if there is more than one player at the same time.
This has always been our policy, but now it's official. Please MUDmail me
with any questions you may have.
