The forests south of the Mountains of Mirkwood have long been contested
ground, and now is no different.  The trade route through Mirkwood is
profitable for those travelling it and also those raiding the travellers.  The
orcs have allowed their Uruk-hai allies to shelter within their caves, if
somewhat unwillingly.  As usual the arrangement between these tribes is
strained at best. In related news, the Lords of Gondor have made an agreement
with Troy Volrath to allow the Free Peoples some respite when needed.
