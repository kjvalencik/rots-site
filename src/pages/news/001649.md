> Message 1649 : Wed Jan 11 (Lowtaxx)    :: Gundabad - Jan 2017

In the black of night, a cold wind brings grim whispers from the northern
Misty Mountains. Far to the north a darkness is spreading from the depths of
the mountain fortress of Gundabad. A terrible entity has begun to exert its
will on the surrounding area. After the Dark Lord was destroyed it was
terribly wounded, a tattered spirit held together only with hate. It found
refuge in cold blackness of Gundabad. After decades, it has regained a
fraction of its' former power and its shadowy tendrils have begun to spread
throughout Gundabad, animating former guardians long forgotten.

OOC: Gundabad is live!  Credit goes to:
Azriya for the idea, map, and descriptions.
Azriya and Faewen for designing the items.
Extra thanks in general to Faewen for item balancing in general, because I'm terrible at it.
I guess myself for the mobs, scripting, and some descriptions.
Lastly, the players for testing it out during the contest,
Lego specifically for leading several groups and
helping me find bugs.
