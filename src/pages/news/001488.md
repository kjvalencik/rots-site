> Message 1488 : Mon Nov 20 (Ingolemo)   :: Vinyanost Tombs

The much hyped and long overdue Vinyanost Tombs have been completed.  In
this news post I will talk about the zone OOC.  There is a book in the
Vinyanost library that explains the situation more eloquently.  The same
information is also posted on rotsmud.org in the Mythology section.

I want to emphasize that this is a zone for all creatures of Arda.  If for
some reason it is not, send me a mudmail.  This zone is also more than just a
'nuke-em' zone.  There are riddles involved that need to be solved.

This is an incrimental zone.  This means that the deeper you go, the harder
it will become to continue.  Newbies, mid-level characters, and groups of
legends should all be able to find something inside.

But please, and this is your official warning, turn back before it is too
late. This is not a zone that is meant to be entirely explored and conquered
on day one.  I will especially warn you that if you should ever find the
Undead Gatekeeper, he guards a great evil that is not easily overcome.

As a side note, there are many scripts involed in the zone, over 30 new mobs
and over 50 new objects were added.  So there should be plenty of fun for all.
