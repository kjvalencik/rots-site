The bug causing the game to crash involving the hobbit mother
should be fixed.  If you encounter anything strange with this
mudmail me please.

Emerald encrusted robe has been changed slightly.  You will
not need to exchange it for a new version as it will update
automatically.

"A pile of ancient shards" may now be stored in rent.

Enjoy.
