> Message 1518 : Sun Jun 10 (Prami)      :: Mud is back up

Mud is back up at rots.us 3791.  DNS resolution should work for most of
you.  For all others, please use 216.10.48.140 3791.  Tell to your friends who
can't connect.   Our apologies from the whole wizteam here at ROTS for the MUD
downtime.  It was due to events out of our control.  MUD had moved to another
server which should provide good connectivity and stable playing environment.
