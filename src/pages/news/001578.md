The mumak has been slightly weakened.

Lunaron and the mumak are now -slightly- easier to butcher.

The final reward of the Kabaal quest has had its load probability
adjusted.  It is now more likely to get something from the
armor chest.

Some items from Goblin Gate have been adjusted - the glittering
crown and many staves.

Questions, concerns, or complaints?  Mudmail me.
