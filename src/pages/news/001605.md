I found and fixed a small bug in Lindia's quest, that was preventing
people from doing the quest if it had already been done a number of
times that day.

I also, however, looked into WHY people were doing this quest an
inordinate number of times. And surprise surprise, I found an exp
reward in the quest that had potential for abuse. That exp reward
has been completely removed.
