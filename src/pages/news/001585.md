> Message 1585 : Fri May  8 (Azriya)     :: The Shadow Rises

The increasing aid of Gondor to Vinyanost and the free peoples of the
Anduin vale has become a minor nuisance to the Lords of Dol Guldur.  In
reponse, Dol Guldur has taken an interest in fortifying their domain. They
have sent a company of orcs and uruks to reinforce the stronghold of the young
uruk mage.

Expect changes in the area.
