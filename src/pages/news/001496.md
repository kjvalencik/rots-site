> Message 1496 : Tue Feb  6 (Elagor)     :: Concerning the Race of Men

It has been whispered in my ear that the cloaked figure in the Frothy Mug
is seeking the assistance of a Human.  He promises a grand reward to whichever
human is able to complete the quest.  It must be warned that only those of
whom are not hindered by locked doors are to accept his task.  Grave
consequences will come to those that do not heed this warning.
