Recently, it has come to attention that a band of orcs had been raiding the
Old Forest Road, successfully killing and looting merchants and travelers.
But, it seemed during an ambush by the orcs, a colony of spiders spoiled their
trap, causing the orcs to get routed and forced to stray far into Mirkwood.
They haven't been seen since, but they managed to get away with quite a bit of
loot, and most likely a distaste of the spiders of Mirkwood...

OOC: New stuff deep in the heart of mirkwood, should be fun, and quite dangerous.
