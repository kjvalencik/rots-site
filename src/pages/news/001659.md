Balance Tweaks:
* Archery base and scaling damage has been reduced by a modest amount.
* Archery is less dependent on accuracy for hit-chance.  Net hit-
** chance slightly reduced.
* Raise the strength soft cap, and standardize the strength cap between races.
** All races now soft cap at 22 strength (other than halflings - they still
soft cap at 20 - small buggers).

Bug Fixes:
* Ride/lead changes:
* * You cannot ride a mount that is following someone else.
* * You cannot ride a tame-based mount if you are unable to tame that mount.
* * You cannot lead a tame-based mount if you are unable to tame that mount.
* Characters up to level 20 can now be deleted without Imm intervention.
* The group leader, and all group members in the room, get kill credit/XP for
** any character/mob killed by a member of the group.
* Orcs now get XP/fame/exploits for any kills that their followers get even if
** they are not engaged.
* * The same applies to rangers/tames and mystics/guardians.
* Fix archery crash related to orc followers firing arrows.
