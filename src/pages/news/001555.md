> Message 1555 : Mon Mar  3 (Vakaur)     :: Trap and ambush changes

- Trap is now operational.  You should no longer get the dreaded
  'You can not do it this way' message when trying to lay a trap.
- Trap applies a bash affection when it lands.
- Traps will no longer be instantly disarmed if a player sees the
  person laying the trap.  The trap will just be less likely to
  succeed.
- Trap damage is now based 100% on ambush damage.
- Ambush damage is now affected by weapon damage.  A harder hitting,
  heavier weapon will do more damage.  Keep in mind, however, that
  high bulk still reduces the damage done by ambush (and hence by
  trap).  The advantages of harder hitting weapons are more apparent
  as the amount of hp of the victim goes down.
- Ambush and trap are less likely to succeed when the ambusher/trapper
  has a high amount of skill encumbrance.

Aesthetic changes:
- The 'time' command now shows the year and the age.
- Months from the calendar of the Steward's Reckoning will now be
  displayed with the full accents from Tolkien's work, if you have
  the latin1 setting enabled.



Miscellaneous changes:
- Some big changes to scripts (which were slated to go in previously,
  but mysteriously did not make it) have gone in.  Be on the lookout
  for scripts that may be malfunctioning, and notify an immortal if
  you happen to find any such scripts.

Enjoy,
vakaur
