> Message 1564 : Fri Jun 20 (Felagund)   :: Moria Feedback Required

First, for those of you who are unaware, the vast amount of code changes
being implemented with the Moria event are currently listed in the
Announcements section of the forums at www.rots.us/forums/ . Further, since we
are at a crossroads of sorts in our progress in Moria, we want -your- opinion,
so please everyone read the thread at http://rots.us/forums/viewtopic.php?t=52
Finally, just a reminder that if you want an account on the forums be sure to
sign up with a valid character name (otherwise we will think you are a random
spammer and will not activate your forum account!). We thank everyone for your
help in this matter.
