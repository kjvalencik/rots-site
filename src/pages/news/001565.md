The codebase changes for Moria are nearing feature-completion, so
it's natural for us to look for a few players to playtest them.
If you're interested in playtesting code-related changes, then
please PM me on the official forums at http://rots.us/forums.
If you don't have an account there, please remember to use one of
your character's names in-game so that we can identify you from
the regular host of spammers.
