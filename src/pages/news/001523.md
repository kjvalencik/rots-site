> Message 1523 : Mon Jun 25 (Azriya)     :: Equipment stealing

Since it has been unclear in the past, I will attempt to clarify what it
means to steal equipment.  Stealing equipment is illegal and will be punished.
Equipment stealing from a mob is when player A kills a mob with some equipment
and player B takes it without player A's permission. Equipment stealing from a
player is more complex.  When a whitey dies to a darkie (or mob in PK), the
darkie has the option of taking all or none of the equipment. If the darkie
leaves a corpse full of equipment, whiteys are not welcome to take it without
the dead whitey's consent.   On the dark side it works the same way.  If a
darkie dies to a whitey, the whitey can leave the equipment or not.  Other
darkies may not take the equipment without the dead darkie's permission.

Convoluted, I know.  Questions, mudmail me.
