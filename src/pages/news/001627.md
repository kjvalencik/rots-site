Hello All
It seems the characters Freddy and Bughuul had had an odd problem the past couple days in that
they have had 130 and 160 db respectively. A rather high amount which should not be possible
If you notice a similar issue with a character of yours, you should in some way contact an imm
The facebook group will likely be the fastest response, but you can mudmail me and/or Azriya

If you do notice this, you may not play the character because it is an unfair advantage.
Penalties may ensue
