The caravans to the Northern Waste have recently set out a call for help.
The village on the Icebay of Forochel has been unreachable and all
communication has ceased. A band of adventurers is needed to solve the mystery
of the village for glory or loot.  This is a land of freezing cold and
monstrous trolls, so only the brave or stupid need apply. A dwarven caravan
leaves from the ranger camp west of Vinyanost and a goblin caravan has been
spotted leaving the hills to the north.

OOC:  This zone is based on the Icebay of Forochel at the northern
end of the Misty Mountains.  http://www.tuckborough.net/lands.html is
a good site if you're interested in some history.  Read the section
about Forodwaith.

There are two mobs and one weapon that are not allowed to leave the
zone.  Mechanics are in place to ensure this does not happen, but as
we have seen in the past resourceful RoTS players have tried to find
ways to go around mechanics.  Anyone caught with the axe or following
dwarves out of the zone will be punished HARSHLY.  This is your only
warning.

That being said, have fun and use caution.. it is a dangerous zone!
