> Message 1441 : Sat Jan  7 (Azriya)     :: Changes in the South

An irritated sigh escaped the figure as he peered out to the north. The
constant stream of troops from northern mirkwood he had expected had not ever
materialized.  His envoys had been sent north with large money pouches to
bring the forces south, here to the ancient fortress of Dol-Guldur.  Of course
the Magus could not be swayed, but the rest of the evil residing in the
mountains and near the Old Forest Road had promised to send their troops.  The
tall figure began pacing his watch, thinking aloud.  Perhaps the reason the
troops did not make it to Dol Guldur was as simple as the road.  The last time
he had travelled it, the snaking path was difficult to follow.  He had made a
decision.  His existing troops would be sent to rebuild the Warpath.  5,000
orcish axes would make a swath plenty wide for the troops to come south on. He
rested his gauntleted hands together and gave the order for the work to begin.
Soon, his army would be complete.
