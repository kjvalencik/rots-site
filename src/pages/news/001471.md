The tattooed goblins of Goblin Gate now have keyword orc
and are more comparable (yet still different) from other
recruits of the same level.  Another orc recruit has been
added to the ranks of the orcs.  Burly orcish soldiers
and berserkers now vary slightly, where they had
identical stats before.

A Dark Lord has appeared, giving a face, if not a name,
to the rising Shadow in Mirkwood.  The fortress of Dol-
Guldur has undergone extensive changes. The orcs of Dol-
Guldur have been forced out of their home, to the
forefront of the defenses of Dol Guldur.   Orcs have been
ordered to patrol the Warpath and Mor Erlond.  The Dark
Lord is a being of such power any of the free people (or
immortals favoring the forces of good) would be foolish
to even enter his presence.  Attacking him is suicide.
You've been warned >:-)

A quest in Goblin Gate involving a particular goblin
and eagles has been modified and completed.



The ivory spear has seen slight improvement

This is not a full list of all the changes.  Other things
all over Arda have changed, but the major ones are listed
here.  If you find something unusual, or new, feel free to
contact Ulwe or Myself with any questions.
