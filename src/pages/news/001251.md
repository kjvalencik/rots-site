> Message 1251 : Tue May 13 (Vaitya)     :: Mounts

There has recently been a rising popularity with stealing the lizard
mounts from other players. This will no longer be tolerated. From this point
on it will be considered a general abuse of a bug in the game. The mounts
should be ridable only by their tamers and no-one else. Furthermore, taming
and "giving" away a lizard mount to someone is no longer acceptable either, as
this would also be considered an abuse of a general bug in the mount system.
To sum up this post, stealing or giving away of someones lizard mounts is no
longer acceptable. At some point in ths future this code will be altered to
make this a non-issue, but for now the punishments will be the following.
First offence - loss of 3 levels
Second offence - loss of 5 levels
Third offence - deletion of character

PS - if your character already has a lizard mount and should not,
please notify an imp ASAP and it will be exchanged for a proper mount
for the race of your character. This means that this rule is not
retro-active, so please be forthcoming and everything will go smoothly.
Thanks for your co-operation.
