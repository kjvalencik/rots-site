> Message 1403 : Thu Jun  2 (Vakaur)     :: Guardian

Guardian has been altered to provide three options to its caster:
aggressive, defensive and mystic.  This option must be provided by
the caster when casting the spell, and depending on the choice of
the caster, a guardian proficient in offense, defense or mystical
aptitude will be created to guard its master.  As a result, the
spirit cost of creating a guardian has been increased.
