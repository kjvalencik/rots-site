> Message 1366 : Thu Dec  2 (Ingolemo)   :: Char Separation / Cross Race

Situations arise that make us have to make new rules. This time, someone
dies on uruk, logs whitie too fast and yells. Then another whitie proceeds to
chat the guys char names on globals or something. The person breaking the 20
min rule will be punished. The person chatting char names was giving a
warning. This is your warning -- Do Not Chat / Narrate / Sing / Whatever
someone elses characters. So, breaking characters separation is now illegal
and will result in a minimum of a 1 level demotion. Immortals can stack higher
demotions at their discretion for multiple offenses.

Now go out there and play nice.
