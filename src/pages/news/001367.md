There appears to be some confusion involving the mount quest in DG.  The
only races who can legally lead a mount from DG are the ones who can lead the
mount at the time the quest is done.  It has come to our attention that
players have been "stealing other player's mounts as a reward during PK. This
is not legal, and is a direct exploitation of a bug that occurs once a player
rents with the mount.   Black steeds may only be led by Uruk-Hai, boars may
only be led by Orcs, and Wyvern may only be led by Hobbits.  Anyone caught
leading a mount illegally will be punished to the fullest extent.  Consider
this your warning.  On a side note, we would like to apologize for any trouble
this may cause and ask for your patience with this matter.  Thank you in
advance.

Signed,
Elagor
