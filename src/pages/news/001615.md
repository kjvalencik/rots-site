Some minor changes will be in effect as of next reboot:

Toboldo will no longer give his quest to evil races.

Jaiden will now re-follow if you happen to lose him while
leading him to his destination.

The grub-like creature in the underground streambed zone has changed. It
no longer has to be triggered to load (frankly, the trigger made no sense
anyway)... which means that this mob is now a permanent resident of its
little part of the cave system. Travelers be warned!

In addition, the butcher for the grub-like creature has been made
slightly easier.

Any problems, questions, or concerns, send me a game mail.
