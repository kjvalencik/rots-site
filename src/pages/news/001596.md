> Message 1596 : Wed Dec 23 (Blent)      :: Tweaks to Armor

A few pieces of armor have been tweaked.

Specifically, the mithril armor from the cold-drake has been standardized,
the ancient mithril breastplate has been completely remodeled (and re-named),
and the light silver helmet has been renamed (but not remodeled).

Additionally, etched leather is now marginally heavier than before, and
provides slightly worse protection.

It also came to our attention that the intended balancing malus on the
long bone sceptre was not functioning properly. This has been fixed.

Send any complaints to Blent.
