There's now an Uruk board in the Uruk Mage Tower area.
There's now a rack in the orc rent in the same area.
Uruk hai are welcome to rent in the orc home in the Misty Mountains.
A large plume of smoke has risen in the north of the Misty Mountains.

Any questions or concerns, email rots.staff@gmail.com.
thanks,
A
