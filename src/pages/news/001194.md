I have recently just had to demote a character for using language that is
not acceptable here. The language was in the form of a racial slur that was
apparently sadi as a joke. It wasn't funny.  That type of language will not be
tolerated, as has been stated in the news many times in the past.  Racial
slurs, sexual slurs, sexual harrassment, religious slurs and the like will be
punished upon discovery - NO MATTER WHAT THE CONTEXT WAS.  The will be no
mercy for this type of nonsense - no matter who you are, or if you are "very
best friends" with the player who is the target.  If you want to be racist or
a bigot then do it somewhere else, you are not welcome here.
