Explorers have found a new section of traversable forest south of Dark
Lake. A team of adventure seeking men went in the area, but only a couple made
it back out.  OOC - This completes my original vision of the SouthEast
Mirkwood design that I drew up in 2001. This zone also has some complicated
and dangerous areas, do not wander in looking for simple forest trolls.
