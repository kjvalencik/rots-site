> Message 1376 : Mon Mar 21 (Khronos)    :: Changes

There are a few minor code changes that will be in place as of next reboot.
- Orcish commanders will no longer be able to use the follow command
- The mighty Uruk-hai will no longer want to follow lesser Orc's
- Growing respect among Orcish followers, for their masters refusal to
follow anybody else into battle has lead to an increased willingness of stronger
orc followers to follow one commander into battle. Also the number of followers
a commander can recruit has risen.

Enjoy
