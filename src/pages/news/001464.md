> Message 1464 : Fri Feb 10 (Elagor)     :: Surviving Breeders

The master breeder and a couple of followers were able to escape from the
beasts that overran their former home.  It has been told of them pitching camp
somewhere in Central Mirkwood, borrowing material from a tentmaker nearby.
However, whispers say that they also are no longer able to control their
trained wargs.  It is also spoken of other survivors from the attack are
beginning to appear and making their way to the camp, after a quick stop for
supplies at the tentmaker, whom is just to the north.  They are expecting to
make the final leg of their journey in the coming weeks.
