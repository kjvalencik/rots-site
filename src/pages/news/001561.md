> Message 1561 : Wed Mar 26 (Vakaur)     :: Durin VII and a Host of Dwarves...

In the past years, relations between the northeastern settlements of
Dale and Lake-town have grown increasingly estranged from the Dwarven
metropolis of Erebor.  These dwarves, however, are known to withdraw
from political relations without warning or reason; and thus the
council in Lake-town paid no special regard to this lapse in
communication.

Quite surprised, then, were the elders of Lake-town when--in the midst
of a frosty Narvinye morning--they were awakened to an urgent report:
the dwarves were moving.  Citizens tending the fertile farm land along
the river leading to the Long Lake had sighted a large host of dwarves,
armed for war, crossing the river and marching south towards the Old
Forest Road.
