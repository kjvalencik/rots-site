> Message 1451 : Mon Jan 23 (Azriya)     :: Movement in the South

Long had the old man fought to keep his small settlement safe from the
nearby lurking evil of Dol Guldur.  Training his people how to react to raids
had likely been the reason the small outpost of the free peoples had stood
this long.  His scouts had reported more numerous orc raiding parties
travelling the Warpath to the east, and this was reason for concern.  John the
chieftain asked for help from an old friend, the chief of a village buried
deep in the mountains of Mirkwood.  Baranor was a great friend, but he lacked
the resources to help John as he wanted.  He sent two of his young soldiers to
help the small town of Tawarost survive, wishing he could send more. Baranor
then sent word to Thranduil, whom he had kept in touch with for years.
Thranduil was in similar straits to Baranor, and could not send much help if
any.  He did send a scouting party to southern mirkwood, to find out the truth
about the growing orcish activity.  The last word from the scouts was that
they had discovered a seemingly new breed of plant, which healed the good
people around it.  They stopped their trek for a time to investigate the
hidden valley this plant lived in.

OOC:  Tawarost defense increased slightly.  Elves spotted in a hidden
vale containing a healing plant.
