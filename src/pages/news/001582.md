There is a slight bug with the script on the massive, bristly
spider in the underground streambed.

Players trying to kill this mob are advised to initiate the fight
as quickly as possible to prevent a bug that will cause the spider
to disappear instead of returning to the area below its web to
wait for more victims. Once the spider has been damaged once, this
is no longer an issue.

Sorry for any inconvenience. Hopefully I'll find some time and
motivation to fix this. Otherwise, use the mentioned workaround.
