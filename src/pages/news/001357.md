> Message 1357 : Thu Jul 22 (Vakaur)     :: search and awareness

- search has been changed to be a good bit more effective
  in finding hidden characters.  note that it is still
  benefited by the awareness skill.
- the effect awareness plays in both avoiding an ambush
  and reducing the damage inflicted by an ambush has been
  increased dramatically.

i'm interested to hear how this affects the current ranger
imbalance.
