> Message 1466 : Mon Feb 13 (Ulwe)       :: Goblins in Mirkwood

The goblin leader, understandably anxious about the terrible beast now
trapped within his caves, has ordered his minions to prepare a better escape
route from that region of the forest. With little skill or subtlety, the
goblins have hewn a crude path that connects both to the Shaded Warpath and to
Mor Erlond, giving them a greater chance of survival should the menace ever be
unleashed.

As of next reboot.
