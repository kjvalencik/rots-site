Elf friends now exist. Becoming an elf friend is something I'll leave
to the rest of you to figure out, however, I must first explain this.

Elf friendship is represent by an object. if this object is dropped,
it cannot be picked up. It cannot be looted, so if you die you lose
elf friend status.

To use your elf friend status, give the object to the person you
want to let know you are an elf friend. If he cares, he'll react
and give it back to you. If he doesn't he'll just keep it because
he thinks you gave him a present. Understanding that since you
can't loot it and give it back, for the time being I will answer
the question 'Should I give this to this mob' or 'I gave my elf
friendship away, can you help me?'

Right now, aside from dying or dropping your status inducing
item there is no way to lose elf friendship status. However,
in the future this will definately change.

Good luck and enjoy.
