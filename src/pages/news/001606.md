> Message 1606 : Fri Mar 19 (Ingolemo)   :: Immortal Restructuring

The Management Team has decided to make some changes in order to streamline
compliance and remove temptations. At the end of this month (March 31), all
Maia will be set to retired on the production server. All development is done
on the test machine, so there is no reason to have access to everything on the
production box. In conjunction with this change, players on the test machine
will be cleaned up and limited to active personnel. If you are active in the
building process, please mudmail me (Ingolemo) before the 31st. This message
applies to levels 92, 93, and 94. Please note that no characters on the
production server will be deleted. Immortal work on the production box
consists entirely of administrative duties therefore non-administrative
personnel do not need privaledges. If you have any questions, feel free to
mudmail me or talk with other high level immortals.
