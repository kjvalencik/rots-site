> Message 1617 : Wed Dec 14 (Azriya)     :: The Werewolf and The Vampire

Sending her thoughts across her time-forgotten domain, the lady searched
for her pet's presence.  Once she located him, she felt great pain coming from
him.  he was always full of pain, but today felt different, somehow.  Leaving
her tower, she flew to  his side where she found him lying, panting.  Stroking
his fur, she knelt and held his head in her hands.  Feeling the burn of the
accursed jewel raging inside him, she used her ancient power to twist the
jewel's energy into a form of healing his undead body could use.  Strengthened
and rejuvenated, the mighty werewolf gave her an evil grin an resumed his
perpetual guarding of their domain.

OOC:  The werewolf of Dark Lake has learned new tricks.  Beware.
