> Message 1423 : Tue Aug 16 (Felagund)   :: Keeping Items over Reboots

In case anyone has forgotten, keeping keys/no-rent items over reboots is
incredibly illegal. It is not difficult to see if multiple copies of
once-per-reboot items are floating around, and anyone caught doing so will be
punished harshly.
