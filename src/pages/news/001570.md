> Message 1570 : Sun Oct 19 (Blent)      :: Small Updates, One Bugfix

- Fixed a bug with the huge, grub-like creature. You will no longer
find yourself fighting an invisible mobile.

- It is now a bit easier for players to find what is responsible
for dragging them underwater, in the black, scaly serpent's lake.

- The underwater maze in the black, scaly serpent's lake is no
longer quite so random. Specifically, it is now MUCH easier to access
all of the underwater areas, but it is still just as difficult to
return to the surface.

- The black, scaly serpent will disarm people fighting it MUCH less
often.

These will be in within the next few days.
