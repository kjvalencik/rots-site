> Message 1492 : Mon Jan 22 (Azriya)     :: The Mountains Tremble

The ranger lay silent, hidden behind the bushes.  There was no activity at
the watering hole a few yards distant, but patience was one of this hunter's
virtues. As he eyed the surroundings, a large elk entered the clearing around
the water, sniffing the air intently.  After a few minutes of nosing the air
and peering about, the elk seemed content he was alone, and headed in for a
drink.  The ranger drew his bow, taking aim just behind the shoulder blade.
Just as he was about to fire, the very ground below his feet shook and threw
him to his side.  The elk immediately raised his head from the water and
crashed off through the forest at high speed. The ranger wondered what ancient
force beneath the earth had ruined his hunt. As he trekked back to the outpost
to confer with this peers about this event, he noticed a large sheer scarp, at
least 5 yards high, directly north of the camp. The lush hills were now even
further separated from the great Misty Mountains.
