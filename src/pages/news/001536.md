> Message 1536 : Tue Oct  2 (Azriya)     :: Lhuth and Uruk-Hai/Orc cooperation

There appears to be some confusion as to what is legal under this topic.
Lhuth and Uruk-hai/Orc are not allowed to cooperate.  The one exception is
when there is a common enemy around. So if an elf shows up, you are allowed to
all join forces and fight the elf.  You are NOT allowed to stand in the same
room, setting a trap, chatting, trading equipment, or anything of the like.
If Lhuth and Hai/Orc are in the same room they must fight.  Period. Consider
this your warning.  Anyone caught breaking this rule will receive 10 level
demotion for the first offense, 30 level demotion for second offense.
