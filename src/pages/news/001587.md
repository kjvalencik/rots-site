> Message 1587 : Tue May 12 (Ulwe)       :: Trouble on Mor Erlond

Karugh, unhappy with the plans to divert more reinforcements to the new
tower defenses, has managed to use his influence with the Emissary from Dol
Guldur to have a small contingent recalled to his command.  Unfortunately,
despite having left the tower gates several days ago, they have failed to
report in at the Mor Erlond fort.  Scouts dispatched to look for them have
searched the entirety of the stone path and the shortcut across to the shaded
Warpath and found no trace of the lost troops.  They did, however, report the
faint but unmistakable stench of -elf- wafting through the air  before being
redeployed to investigate its source, and have not been heard from since.
