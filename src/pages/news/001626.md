> Message 1626 : Thu Apr 12 (Faewen)     :: Robe Changes

Fine Blue/Fine Black robes have been changed! If you have an old robe you
will need to trade it in with an immortal! :) You'll like the changes, don't
worry. Silvery-White robe has lost its dodge. You may want to start robe
shopping for your buffers. No need to trade in silvery-white, it automatically
updated. Thanks!
